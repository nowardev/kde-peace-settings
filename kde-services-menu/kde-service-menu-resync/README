WHAT IS IT ? 

It's a script that can help you to install service menu on kde and it's compatible with GHNS 
(servicemenuinstallation kde-service-menu*.ta.gz)

there are 4 mode 

1 installation local 
2 installation system 
3 deinstallation local 
4 deinstallation system


the functions will run if folders exist, deinstall modes are based on the files that are presents in the main folder , if there are /mainfolder/usr/bin/scripts it will remove /usr/bin/scripts etc.
 

HOW SHOUL I USE IT ?

you need to put install script in the main folder like you can see in this tree

we have

1 file .desktop 
1 bash script 
1 eventually the menu entry .desktop file 
1 install script :)
1 deinstall script that is the same of install 
other stuff like read me and license 


apt-peace-tool$ tree

                └── ServiceMenus
                    └── aptk-service.desktop

ADVANCED MODE 

as you can see there is extra_bash_function_installation

you can have :

extra_bash_function_installation
extra_bash_function_deinstallation

on these file you can create  extra functions if these file exist the main script will load them.

BUT YOU NEED TO USE THESE NAMES FOR EXTRA FUNCTIONS :

function_extra_install_global
function_extra_deinstall_global

function_extra_install_local
function_extra_deinstall_local

function_extra_install_system
function_extra_deinstall_system


the global function will be run on the deinstall or install process doesn't matter if you want install locally o system wide , then it will be loaded the local or wide functions 


infact in this particular example i have to do something more than only install the script i have added some extra function to it 

EXAMPLE  extra_bash_function_installation




function_extra_install_global(){
	
	 my commands 
}
